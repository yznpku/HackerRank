# For student i, we can find two (possibly empty) ranges
# of time when they are available:
# * [0, i - t_i]
# * the first one wrapped around 0, which is (i, i - t_i + n]
#
# To get the available student number, we then have to add
# one to the counting array for each minute mark in these intervals.
# This can be done in O(n) time using the awesome algorithm
# described at http://stackoverflow.com/a/18410273.
